# Multithreaded Python Socket Logger
This is a simple program to listen on a socket and write the output to a file. 

Also includes a simple script to start it on multiple ports.

# TODO
* Drop privileges
* Add PID support for easier killing
* Add UDP support
* Add support to output a banner on selected ports
