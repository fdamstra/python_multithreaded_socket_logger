# Multithreaded Python Socket Logger
This is a simple program to listen on a socket and write the output to a file. 

Also includes a simple script to start it on multiple ports.

# Starting:
Run `python server.py` for exact syntax. Simple way to start with console logging
is `python server.py --port 5000 --debug`.

# Ending
Should be able to `killall python server.py`.

# TODO
* Add UDP support
* Add support to output a banner on selected ports
* Add PID support for easier killing
